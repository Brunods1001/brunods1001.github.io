## Numerical and symbolic differentiation in Julia

```julia:squareplot
x = 1:10
f(x) = x^2
plot(x, f.(x))
savefig(joinpath(@OUTPUT, "squareplot.svg"))
```

\fig{squareplot}

### Numerical differentiation
But what if a you have data that changes, and you want to analyze how changing your data affects the result of your function?

This is where differentiation comes in. You can take the difference between a function at some input $x$ and a function at the same input plus a small difference divided by the small difference to approximate the function's derivative at $x$.

$$\frac{df(x)}{dx} \approx \frac{f(x) + \Delta x}{\Delta x}$$

Let's write a function to approximate differentiation.


```julia:f2logplot
"Returns a function that approximates its derivative"
function diffapprox(f, deltax)
	x -> (f(x + deltax) - f(x)) / deltax 
end
vec_deltax = 0:1:5
f₂(x) = log(x) * x^3
df₂(x) = x^2 + 3x^2 * log(x)
plot(x, df₂.(x), label = "Truth")
for deltax in vec_deltax
	y = diffapprox(f₂, deltax).(x)
	plot!(x, y, alpha = 0.8, linestyle = :dot, label = deltax)
end
plot!()
savefig(joinpath(@OUTPUT, "f2logplot.svg"))
```

\fig{f2logplot}

### Symbolic differentiation
What about for more complicated functions? Let's try 

$$f_2(x) = log(x) * x^3$$

If we solve this on paper using the product rule we get:

$$\frac{df_2}{dx} = x^2 + 3x^2log(x)$$

Let's check with sympy to make sure using the `diff` function directly on our Julia function.

```julia:./code/sympy_ex1
using SymPy
@show diff(f₂)
```

\output{./code/sympy_ex1}

This symbolic result from SymPy is exactly what we have above!
You can even evaluate this symbolic equation:

```julia:./code/sympy_ex2
@show diff(f₂)(10)
```
\output{./code/sympy_ex2}
```julia:./code/sympy_ex3
@show convert(Float64, diff(f₂)(10))
```
\output{./code/sympy_ex3}
