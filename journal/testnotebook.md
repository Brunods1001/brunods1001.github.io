## What I learned today
- DevOps: how to configure a Kubernetes cluster and expose its applications through their containers, services, ingresses, and hostnames.

## Reflection
It's been a busy week in my personal life and I have not had much free time. I'm already losing sleep to get work done, but I want to force some time to learn something today. The hard part is choosing something to work on! Whatever I choose to do, I want to see it through to the end!

I think I will choose to follow computational thinking with Julia from MIT, because of three reasons:
1. I want to learn to model in Julia.
2. It's written in Julia, so I can get better at the language and also communicate it through this website which is written in a [Julia framework](https://franklinjl.org/workflow/index.html#tag_pages).
3. It has a structured course load.

**I've had multiple false starts with this course. Here's to the first true start**
